The icons (Minus the Wikipedia and GitHub icons) were designed by sensationalfix, available [here](http://sensationalfix.com/flat-social-icons-eps/).

The Wikipedia icon uses the circle from SenationalFix's icons and the W from [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=91&L=1).

The GitHub icon is [blacktocats.ai](https://github.com/github/media/blob/master/octocats/blacktocats.ai) produced by Cameron McEfee.
